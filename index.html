<p>The idea behind the project</p>

<p>The project was born to grow up day by day thank to the community support and the simple approach to it. There are many features to be included into the first alpha and we are excited to start the "real game".
Why a new free ISP project ?</p>

<p>The idea was born when here at Shine Software headquarters we thought that the customer registration process was annoying because repeated 5 times in 5 different software. So we thought to build a little and modular software in order to simplify our customers accounting tasks.
